# Specification Quality Checklist: User Experience Improvements & Bug Fixes

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All checklist items met

**Details**:
- All 6 user stories are prioritized (P1, P2, P3) and independently testable
- 26 functional requirements defined with clear MUST statements
- All requirements are testable and technology-agnostic
- 8 success criteria with measurable metrics (time, percentage, qualitative measures)
- Edge cases cover browser compatibility, rapid interactions, and error scenarios
- Assumptions document reasonable defaults (localStorage, modern browsers, venue abbreviations)
- Constraints define backward compatibility and performance requirements
- Out of scope clearly defined (no backend persistence, no automatic dark mode, no multiple player support)
- No implementation details present - specification stays at "what/why" level

**No clarifications needed**: All requirements have reasonable defaults and can proceed to planning phase.

## Notes

- Feature is ready for `/speckit.plan` - no blocking issues identified
- Travel time validation (User Story 4) will require testing with actual routes but requirements are clear
- Visual design refresh (User Story 5, P3) is intentionally vague to allow designer flexibility while maintaining functional requirements
