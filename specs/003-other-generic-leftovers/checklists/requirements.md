# Specification Quality Checklist: Replace Generic Placeholder Content

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality
✅ **PASS**: Spec is written in user-centric language focusing on what needs to happen (accurate privacy policy, HockeyGoTime-branded pages) without specifying how to implement it. No framework or code-level details included.

### Requirement Completeness
✅ **PASS**:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete
- All 9 functional requirements are testable (can verify privacy text accuracy, About page content, favicon display, asset cleanup)
- All 5 success criteria are measurable and verifiable
- Success criteria use technology-agnostic metrics (zero misleading statements, 100% browser support, file counts)
- Three user stories with complete acceptance scenarios using Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases address key boundary conditions
- Out of scope section clearly bounds feature (no legal review, no new branding assets, no internationalization)
- Assumptions and dependencies documented

### Feature Readiness
✅ **PASS**:
- Each functional requirement maps to user stories and success criteria
- User scenarios are prioritized (P1: Privacy, P2: About, P3: Favicon) and independently testable
- Success criteria are measurable without implementation knowledge
- No technical leakage (doesn't specify React components, file paths in requirements, etc.)

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, testable, and focused on user needs without implementation details. No clarifications needed.

## Next Steps

Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create the implementation plan.
