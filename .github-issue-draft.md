# Initial HockeyGoTime Implementation - SCAHA Schedule Chat MVP

## Problem
Need a conversational AI interface for SCAHA youth hockey families to query game schedules in natural language. Parents and players currently have to manually navigate scaha.net dropdowns and CSV files to find game times, opponents, and venue information.

## Solution
Built HockeyGoTime - a Next.js 15 chat application that integrates with the scaha.net-mcp server via STDIO transport:

**Core Features:**
- Natural language schedule queries: "Who does the 14B Jr Kings play on October 5th?"
- Automatic input normalization: "14B" → "14U B", "Jr Kings 1" → "Jr. Kings (1)"
- Home/away detection and jersey color recommendations
- Venue and rink information with conversational formatting
- Hockey-parent-friendly responses

**Technical Implementation:**
- SCAHA MCP Client with STDIO transport (`/lib/mcp/client/scaha-client.ts`)
- API route with AI SDK 5 streaming (`/app/api/hockey-chat/route.ts`)
- System prompt with comprehensive normalization rules (`/components/agent/hockey-prompt.ts`)
- TypeScript types for `get_schedule` tool
- Chat UI using existing ChatAssistant component

**Architecture:**
- Next.js 15 + App Router
- AI SDK 5 with OpenAI GPT-4o
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) for schedule data
- shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS v4

**MVP Scope (Working):**
✅ Schedule queries via `get_schedule` MCP tool
✅ Natural language understanding with input normalization
✅ Home/away and jersey information
✅ Venue and rink details

**Post-MVP (Future):**
- Team standings (get_team_stats)
- Player statistics (get_player_stats)
- Travel time calculator (Google Routes API)
- Hotel suggestions

## Rabbit holes
- Don't attempt to implement team stats or player stats yet - SCAHA MCP server only has `get_schedule` working
- Avoid adding authentication/user profiles in MVP - keep it simple and stateless
- Don't try to scrape scaha.net directly - use the MCP server abstraction
- Avoid complex date parsing logic - let the AI handle date normalization via the system prompt

## No gos
- Changing from AI SDK 5 or switching LLM providers
- Moving away from MCP architecture for schedule data
- Replacing shadcn/ui or changing component library
- Using npm or yarn instead of pnpm
- Checking in `.env.local` with API keys or local paths
- Committing architecture-specific build artifacts (node_modules, *.tsbuildinfo)
