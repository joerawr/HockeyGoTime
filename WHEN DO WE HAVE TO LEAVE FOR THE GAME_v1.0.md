WHEN DO WE HAVE TO LEAVE FOR THE GAME, DAD?
- Inputs:
-- 'start address'
-- minutes to 'get ready'
-- minutes 'before game' time, 60, 65, 70
-- 'Min wake' up time
- navitgate to the correct schedule on scaha.net (there's two pull downs)
- download the schedule in CSV
- Ask for the 'game date' they want to calculate
- extract from the CSV on the date of the game:
-- name of the venue
-- how to map the venue to the correct address and store it? 'end address'
-- 'game time'
-- home or away (to determine jersey color)

- Convert 'game time' to 'game time UTC', respecting daylight savings time
- Calculate arrival:
-- subtract 'get ready' and 'before game' from 'game time UTC'
-- That is our 'desired arrival UTC' time
- Using Google Routes API calculate 'leave time UTC'
-- 'start address'
-- 'end address'
-- 'desired arrival UTC'
-- 'game date'
-- Google maps api key
